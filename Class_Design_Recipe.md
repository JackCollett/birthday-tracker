# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So I don't forget the details
I want to keep a record of friends' names and birthdates

As a user
So I can make edits when I've got dates wrong
I want to be able to update a record by passing in a name and new date

As a user
So I can make edits when people change their name
I want to be able to update a record by passing in an old and a new name

As a user
So I can remember to send birthday cards at the right time
I want to be able to list friends whose birthdays are coming up soon and to whom I need to send a card

As a user
So I can buy age-appropriate birthday cards
I want to calculate the upcoming ages for friends with birthdays

As a user
So I can keep track of cards sent and to be sent
I want to be able to mark a birthday card for a year as "done"


## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._
# view list
# update name and date
# update name
# list upcoming birthdays
# upcoming birthday age
# birthday card tracker


```python
# EXAMPLE

class BirthdayTracker:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   name: string

    def __init__(self, name):
        # Parameters:
        #   name: string
        # Side effects:
        #   Sets the name property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind_me_to(self, task):
        # Parameters:
        #   task: string representing a single task
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects
        #   Saves the task to the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string reminding the user to do the task
        # Side-effects:
        #   Throws an exception if no task is set
        pass # No code here yet
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a name and a task
#remind reminds the user to do the task
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

"""
Given a name and no task
#remind raises an exception
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # raises an error with the message "No task set."

"""
Given a name and an empty task
#remind still reminds the user to do the task, even though it looks odd
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
